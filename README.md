### Models and their performance Metrics
| Metrics  | Logical_Regression | Decision Tree |
|----------|--------------------|---------------|
| Precision | 0.963636 |0.986111 |
| Accuracy | 0.963636 |0.986364 |
| F1 Score | 0.963636  |0.986364 |
| Recall   |0.963636  |0.987287 |

+ Here, Decision Tree model is performing better than Logistic regression model in predicting the suitable crop. Hence, we need to proceed with Decision Tree Model.
